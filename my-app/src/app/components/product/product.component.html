<!-- [property]="value" is for inputing value to that property in the component using @Input() decorator -->
<!-- (property)="function($event)" is for outputing the value that property is emitting as an event, 
    so the value will be passed into the function as an event -->
<!-- Using both [()] is called double binding, it inputs and outputs at the same time depending on the event -->
<!-- The first time it will be an input and it will take it as the default value, then if the event defined occurs, it will input and outputs -->
<!-- In this case, we are giving it the product rating as the default value, once I change the rating in frontend it will then inputs that change and outputs the rating again-->
